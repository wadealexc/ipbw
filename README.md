## About

Better README coming soon to an IKEA near you.

Just `go run main.go`. Configurability is a trap and should be avoided.

The output of a 10-minute crawl was rendered in Cytoscape using an edge-weighted, force-based layout algorithm. Some discovery statistics:

* 3600 unique peers discovered within 10 minutes
